Conclusions

After a deep analysis into the titanic data we have come to certain conclusions upon the survival point of the sinking:

1. The class of a passenger played a major role in the survival point. As we saw through out the analysis, almost ~40% of the survivors belonged to the first class.
2. The sex of a passenger also played an important role in the survival point, the female passengers were given the top priority in saving lives, ~60% of the survivors were female. Children were also given priority, ~59% of the children survived the sinking.
3. Looking into age data, the trend is inclined downwards, indicating less survival for older people. Most of the survivors were of the age between 10-35. But it was interesting to see when compared among sex data, older female passengers had higher survival rate compared to others.
4. The deck of passenger did not have direct effect on the survival rate, but we can say that the decks that were filled with first class passengers viz. deck B, C, D, also E, had higher survival rate.
5. Having a family did not directly effect the survival rate, but the number of members in a family did have some value to add. We saw that passengers with 1-3 family members did have a higher survival rate, but more than 3 make the survial rate fall down drastically.
6. Lastly, travelling alone is never a good idea, as we saw that survival of lone passengers had lower survival rate compared to having atleast 1 family member. So, travel with friends and family, have more fun and also more survival rate if any mishaps.
